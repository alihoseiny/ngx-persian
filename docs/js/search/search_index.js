Many of other persian libraries have unanswered issues from 1-2 year ago.\n* Almost everything has been tested. There are more than 590 unit tests written for all parts. So you can use everything without any fear of breaking things down.\n* It's documented. Everything are clear and you can find anything you want from this document, code document and also unit test.\nHow to Install?\nFor installing this library, you can simply run following command in your Angular app root:\nnpm install ngx-persian --save\nFor installing the library globally, you can run following command instead:\nnpm install ngx-persian -g\nDocuments\nShort documentation of the library is here. For more detailed documents, you can see the code document.\nPipes\nWe are using pipes for formatting values in the templates. We Have 4 Different pipes in the ngx-persian for formatting stuff needed by the persian app developers:\nfaNum\nThis pipe replaces all the English and Arabic digits to the Persian Digits without any need for additional code or parameter.\nFor using this pipe, firstly you need to import the pipe from the library in your module:\nimport {FaNumPipe} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen, like any other pipe, you need to declare the pipe in your module. For this, you should add following line in the declarations array of the @NgModule of your module:\nFaNumPipe,\nNow you can this pipe anywhere you like in your templates.\nFor example, if we want to convert non-english digits in a attribute named: englishTextDigit, we can use this code in our template:\n{{englishTextDigit | faNum}}\nenNum\nThis pipe replaces all the Persian Digits to English digits without any need for additional code or parameter.\nFor using this pipe, firstly you need to import the pipe from the library in your module:\nimport {EnNumPipe} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen, like any other pipe, you need to declare the pipe in your module. For this, you should add following line in the declarations array of the @NgModule of your module:\nEnNumPipe,\nYou can use this pipe anywhere you like in your templates for converting persian digits to english digits.\nFor example, if we want to convert persian digits in a attribute named: persianTextDigit, we can use this code in our template:\n{{persianTextDigit | enNum}}\nYou can see the example usage of these pipes in below GIF:\n\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app or see: related section in code document for EnNumPipe or see: related section in code document for FaNumPipe. \nAlso you can see unit tests of FaNumPipe and unit tests of EnNumPipe for more examples of how input and outputs could be. \nirc\nThis pipe formats currency values for two popular currency types in Iran: Rian and Toman.\nThis pipes accepts one optional parameter for declaring currency type And get's this value as first parameter.\nPossible values for currency type parameter:\n|Value|Output currency type|\n|---|---|\n|r|ریال|\n|rial|ریال|\n|t|تومان|\n|toman|تومان|\nThe default value is r, so if you don't set any currency type, this pipe will consider that you've chosen rial currency type.\nFor using this pipe, firstly you need to import the pipe from the library in your module:\nimport {IRCurrencyPipe} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen, like any other pipe, you need to declare the pipe in your module. For this, you should add following line in the declarations array of the @NgModule of your module:\nIRCurrencyPipe,\nYou can use this pipe anywhere you like in your templates for formatting a currency value in Iranian currency types.\nFor example, For converting a digit to rial:\n{{13750 | irc}} output will be: 13,750 ریال\nYou can pass currency type parameter as below:\n{{13750 | irc:'t'}}\nThe output will be like:\n137,750 تومان\nYou can see the example usage of this pipes in below GIF:\n\nAlso this pipes inherits the Angular decimal pipe. So you can choose different formatting styles for numeric part of formatted currency value and pass yor pattern as second parameter of the pipe.\nFor example, below code recreates default behaviour of the pipe (Grouping each 3 digit from right):\n{{13750 | irc:'r':'1.0-0'}}\nIn regular uses, you never need to pass the second parameter, but it's here for more special usages.\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app or see: related section in code document for IRCurrencyPipe. \nAlso you can see unit tests of IRCurrencyPipe for more examples of how input and outputs could be.\nnationalCode\nThis pipe formats a 10-digit string to national code format like:\nxxx-xxxxxx-x\nFor using this pipe, firstly you need to import the pipe from the library in your module:\nimport {NationalCodePipe} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen, like any other pipe, you need to declare the pipe in your module. For this, you should add following line in the declarations array of the @NgModule of your module:\nNationalCodePipe,\nYou can use this pipe anywhere you like in your templates for formatting iranian national number.\nFor example: 0011753646 | nationalCode produces following text: 001-175364-6\nYou can see the example usage of this pipes in below GIF:\n\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app or see: related section in code document for NationalCodePipe. \nAlso you can see unit tests of NationalCodePipe for more examples of how input and outputs could be.\nServices\nWe provide some useful Angular Services for data validation and conversion. You can Inject Them anywhere you like using Angular DI.\nPersianNumberService\nThis service created for validation of strings contains persian digits and converting other digits to the persian ones.\nFor reading more detailed document, you can see related part of code document of the PersianNumberService.\nAdding PersianNumberService to Your Application\nFor using this service you only need to import it in the file you want to use that in it. Simple as this:\nimport {PersianNumberService} from 'ngx-persian';\nFor Injecting this service, you just need to add it in the constructor of your service or component like this:\nconstructor(private persianNumberService: PersianNumberService) {}\nNow you can use it like other attributes of your class with this keyword.\nSo lets digging deep to the class and see what its methods do:\narabicToPersian\nYou can use this method for converting arabic digits in the input string with persian digits. This method will not change other characters of the string and left them unchanged.\nExample:\ntypescript\nconsole.log(this.persianNumberService.arabicToPersian('٤٥٦'))\n// Expected output: ۴۵۶For more information you can see the related part of code document about arabicToPersian method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the arabicToPersian method.\ncontainsPersian\nThis method checks if input text contains any persian digit. So if there is at least one persian digit in the input, returns true.\nExample:\n```typescript\nif (this.persianNumberService.containsPersian('A long text with english و فارسی words with a persian digit: ۱')) {\n  console.log('Input text contains persian digits.');\n} \nif (!this.persianNumberService.containsPersian('یک متن فارسی با اعداد انگلیسی 156465 که رقم فارسی ندارد.')){\n  console.log('input text does not contain persian digits.');\n}\n``` \nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about containsPersian method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the containsPersian method.\nisPersian\nThis method check if input string contains ONLY persian digits. So if there is any other character, returns false.\nExample:\n```typescript\nif (this.persianNumberService.isPersian('۶۸۷۹۷۹۷')) {\n  console.log('Input string contains only persian numbers.')\n} \nif (!this.persianNumberService.isPersian('۷۶۷۶۸ ۸۹۰۹۷')) {\n  console.log('Input string does not contain only persian numbers');\n} \n```\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about isPersian method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the isPersian method.\ntoEnglish\nConverts all Persian digits in the input string to English digits. This method will not change any other characters of the input.\nExample:\ntypescript\nconsole.log(this.persianNumberService.toEnglish('یک متن با اعداد فارسی مثل ۵۴۳۲۴۴۵'));\n// Expected output: یک متن با اعداد فارسی مثل 5432445\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about toEnglish method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the toEnglish method.\ntoPersian\nThis method converts all English and Arabic digits to the Persian digits. This method will not change any other characters of the input.\nExample:\ntypescript\nconsole.log(this.persianNumberService.toPersian('A long text with english digits: 54484 and Arabic digits: ٤٥٦'));\n// Expected output: A long text with english digits: ۵۴۴۸۴ and Arabic digits: ۴۵۶\nPersianLetterService\nThis service created for validation of strings contains persian letters and converting arabic letters to the persian ones.\nFor reading more detailed document, you can see related part of code document of the PersianLetterService.\nAdding PersianLetterService to Your Application\nFor using this service you only need to import it in the file you want to use that in it. Simple as this:\nimport {PersianLetterService} from 'ngx-persian';\nFor Injecting this service, you just need to add it in the constructor of your service or component like this:\nconstructor(private persianLetterService: PersianLetterService) {}\nNow you can use it like other attributes of your class with this keyword.\nSo lets digging deep to the class and see what its methods do:\ncontainsPersian\nThis method checks if input string contains any persian letter or not. So if there is at least one persian letter in the input, return true.\nBe careful, digits (۱,۲,...) are not letters.\nExample:\n```typescript\nif (this.persianLetterService.containsPersian('Some words and numbers5454 wtih one persian letterی')) {\n  console.log('Input contains persian letters');\n} \nif (!this.persianLetterService.containsPersian('۴۳۵۵ fdhf 45')) {\n  console.log('Input does not contain persian letters.');\n} \n```\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about containsPersian method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the containsPersian method.\nisPersian\nThis method checks if input string contains ONLY persian letters or not.\nIn default mode, if input contains any other character (instead whitespaces and special characters explained below), returns false. But you can control behaviour of this method by second parameter, options.\ntypescript\nisPersian(value: string, options: PLOptions = {\n                                                  persianDigits: false,\n                                                  enDigits: false,\n                                                  symbols: true,\n                                                  whitespaces: true}): boolean\noptions parameter is an object implementing PLOptions interface.\nYou can see possible properties of the options object, their meaning and their default value in the table below:\n|Property|Meaning|Default Value|\n|---|---|---|\n|persianDigits|If sets to true, accepts persian digits plus persian letters in the input string|false|\n|enDigits|If sets to true, accept english digits plus persian letters|false|\n|symbols|Accepts certain symbols plus persian letters. |true|\n|       |Symbols list:                                 ||                                             ||\n|       |  ?$-/:؟!~\"'^_-[]{}()%&*>true, accepts whitespace characters plus persian letters.|true|\nYou can use any combination of those parameters for getting the result you want.\nYou only need to pass parameters of options those are different from default value. Missing properties will fill with default values.\nExample:\n```typescript\nif (this.persianLetterService.isPersian('بدونفاصله'), {whitespaces: false, symbols: false}) {\n  console.log('Input string contains only persian letters, not any other thing.');\n} \nif (this.persianLetterService.isPersian('متن فارسی با فاصله و علائم به صورت پیش‌فرض قابل قبول است.')) {\n  console.log('Input string contains only persian letters, whitespaces and symbols.');\n} \n```\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about isPersian method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the isPersian method.\ntoPersian\nThis method converts arabic letters: ك and ي to persian letters: ک and ی.\nExample:\ntypescript\nconsole.log(this.persianLetterService.toPersian('یك متن فارسي شامل حروف عربی'));\n// Expected output: یک متن فارسی شامل حروف عربی\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about toPersian method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the toPersian method.\nMobilePhoneNumberService\nThis service created for validation of strings contains mobile phone numbers of iranian mobile operators.\nYou can get operator name and validation result of a phone number by methods of this service.\nAdding MobilePhoneNumberService to Your Application\nFor using this service you only need to import it in the file you want to use that in it. Simple as this:\nimport {MobilePhoneNumberService} from 'ngx-persian';\nFor Injecting this service, you just need to add it in the constructor of your service or component like this:\nconstructor(private mobilePhoneNumberService: MobilePhoneNumberService) {}\nNow you can use it like other attributes of your class with this keyword.\nSo lets digging deep to the class and see what its methods do:\nisPhoneNumberPatternValid\n This method only checks if phoneNumber follows valid pattern. means starting by +98 or 0, then a 9 digit and then 9 digits. This method will not check validity of the phoneNumber code and can accept invalid strings those only locking like phone numbers and in reality are not a valid phone number.\nExample:\n```typescript\nif (this.mobilePhoneNumberService.isPhoneNumberPatternValid('09357413028')) {\n  console.log('phone number follows correct pattern');\n} \nif (!this.mobilePhoneNumberService.isPhoneNumberPatternValid('912475')) {\n  console.log('phone number is not valid.');\n} \n```\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about isPhoneNumberPatternValid method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the  isPhoneNumberPatternValid method.\ngetPhoneNumberOperator\nThis method first checks input for following correct pattern explained in the isPhoneNumberPatternValid method.\nThen, Checks all codes of all operators in MobileCodes object. IF finds a matched code, returns persian or english name of that operator from operatorsNames enum.\nIn default, Persian name of operator will return. For controlling language of the output, you can use second optional parameter (nameInEnglish) of this method.\nBy passing true, operator name will return in English. Default value of nameInEnglish parameter is `false.\nIf there is no recognizable operator for inputted mobile number, a InvalidMobileOperatorError will throw.\nAlso if input string does not follow correct pattern, an InvalidMobilePhoneNumberError will throw.\nSupporting Mobile operator companies are listed in table below:\n|Operator Name in English|نام فارسی اپراتور|\n|---|---|\n|irancell|ایرانسل|\n|mci|همراه اول|\n|talia|تالیا|\n|rightel|رایتل|\n|spadan|اسپادان|\n|tkc|شبکه مستقل تلفن همراه کیش|\n|shatel|شاتل|\n|aptel|آپتل|\n|azartel|آذرتل|\n|samantel|سامانتل|\n|lotustel|لوتوس‌تل|\n|anarestan|انارستان|\nWe've provided an enum named operatorsNames you can see it here.\nExample:\n```typescript\nconsole.log(this.mobilePhoneNumberService.getPhoneNumberOperator('09352479965'));\n// Expected output: ایرانسل\nconsole.log(this.mobilePhoneNumberService.getPhoneNumberOperator('+989352479965', true));\n// Expected output: irancell\n```\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about getPhoneNumberOperator method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the   getPhoneNumberOperator method.\nisValidPhoneNumber\nIf phoneNumber follows correct pattern and has valid operator, returns true. Otherwise returns false.\nExample:\n```typescript\nif (this.mobilePhoneNumberService.isValidPhoneNumber('09195574410')) {\n  console.log('mobile phone number is valid.');\n}\nif (this.mobilePhoneNumberService.isValidPhoneNumber('09005574410')) {\n  console.log('mobile phone number is not valid.');\n}\n```\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about isValidPhoneNumber method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the isValidPhoneNumber method.\nnormalizePhoneNumber\nRemoves +98 from the phoneNumber and replaces it with a 0 character. This method will not make any validation on the input.\nExample:\ntypescript\nconsole.log(this.mobilePhoneNumberService.normalizePhoneNumber('+989352479965'));\n// Expected output: 09352479965 \nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about normalizePhoneNumber method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the normalizePhoneNumber method.\nJalaliDateValidatorService\nMethods of this Service doing validation stuff on a Jalali date. You can use this Service using DI in all around of your app for validating Jalali dates without needing to convert them to the Georgian Date.\nAdding JalaliDateValidatorService to Your Application\nFor using this service you only need to import it in the file you want to use that in it. Simple as this:\nimport {JalaliDateValidatorService} from 'ngx-persian';\nFor Injecting this service, you just need to add it in the constructor of your service or component like this:\nconstructor(private jalaliDateValidatorService: JalaliDateValidatorService) {}\nNow you can use it like other attributes of your class with this keyword.\nSo lets digging deep to the class and see what its methods do:\nisJYearLeap\nThis method gets a Jalali year as input. It jalali year is a leap year, returns true. If not, returns false.\nExample:\n```typescript\nif (this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isJYearLeap(1375)) {\n  console.log('1375 is a leap year.');\n} \nif (!this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isJYearLeap(1397)) {\n  console.log('1397 is not a leap year.');\n} \n```\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about isJYearLeap method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the isJYearLeap method.\nisValidJDate\nIf Jalali date is not a valid Jalali date, return false. otherwise returns true.\nInput format of this method is:\nisValidJDate(jYear, jMonth, jDay)\njYear is a Jalali year. jMonth is number of month starting from zero. jDay is day number starting from one.\nCombination of year, month and day should be a valid date in the calendar.\nExample:\n```typescript\nif (this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJDate(1375, 11, 30)) {\n  console.log('Input is a valid Jalali date.');\n} \nif (!this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJDate(1397, 11, 30)) {\n  console.log('Input is not a valid Jalali date.');\n}```\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about isValidJDate method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the isValidJDate method.\nisValidJDay\nChecks if day number is in valid range according to the given year and month.\nFirst six month of the year have 31 days. 5 next months have 30 days and last month maybe has 29 or 30 days.\nThis method checks is day number in the valid range of day numbers of the month in a particular year or not.\nExample:\n```typescript\nif (this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJDay(1375, 11, 30)) {\n  console.log('Input day is valid in Jalali calendar.');\n} \nif (!this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJDay(1397, 11, 30)) {\n  console.log('Input is not valid in Jalali calendar.');\n} \n``` \nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about isValidJDay method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the isValidJDay method.\nisValidJMonth\nChecks if jalali month is in valid range or not. In default, jMonth should start from zero. If you want to start month number from one instead of zero, you should make startFromZero parameter to false.\nisValidJMonth(jMonth: number, startFromZero: boolean)\nBe careful about month number. Only in this method you can choose starting month number from one or zero. In others, month number starts only from zero.\nExample:\n```typescript\nif (this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJMonth(12, false)) {\n  console.log('Month is valid.');\n} \nif (!this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJMonth(12)) {\n  console.log('Month is not valid');\n} \n```\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about isValidJMonth method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the isValidJMonth method.\nisValidJYear\nChecks if jalali year is in acceptable range or not. Acceptable range for this validator is from -61 to 3177.\nExample:\n```typescript\nif (this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJYear(1397)) {\n  console.log('Year is valid.');\n} \nif (!this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJYear(3179)) {\n  console.log('Year is not valid');\n} \n```\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about isValidJYear method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the isValidJYear method.\njMonthLength\nReturns number of days in a given month counting from 1.\njMonthLength(jYear: number, jMonth: number)\njYear is Jalali year number and jMonth is month number starts from zero.\noutput is number of days in given month. First six months of the year have 31 days. 5 next months have 30 days and last month maybe has 29 or 30 days.\nExample:\n```typescript\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateValidatorService.jMonthLength(1375, 11));\n// Expected output: 30\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateValidatorService.jMonthLength(1397, 0));\n// Expected output: 31\n```\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about jMonthLength method. \nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the jMonthLength method.\nnumOfJLeapYears\nReturn number of leap years passed from base year until given Jalali year.\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about numOfJLeapYears method. \nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the numOfJLeapYears method.\nJalaliDateCalculatorService\nThis service converts Georgian date to Jalali and vase versa. You can use all of the methods as static methods.\nAdding JalaliDateCalculatorService to Your Application\nFor using this service you only need to import it in the file you want to use that in it. Simple as this:\nimport {JalaliDateCalculatorService} from 'ngx-persian';\nFor Injecting this service, you just need to add it in the constructor of your service or component like this:\nconstructor(private jalaliDateCalculatorService: JalaliDateCalculatorService) {}\nNow you can use it like other attributes of your class with this keyword.\nJalaliDateValidatorService injected into this service. So if you want to create an instance of this service and don't want to use DI, you should pass an instance of that service in it. But if you are using DI as described before, you don't need to do anything at all.\nSo lets digging deep to the class and see what its methods do:\nconvertToGeorgian\nConverts a valid jalali date to a javascript Date object representing a equivalent Georgian date.\nthis method looking like:\nconvertToGeorgian(jYear: number, jMonth: number, jDay: number)\njYear is a full Jalali year like 1397.\njMonth is month number starting from zero.\njDay in day number starting from one.\nExample:\ntypescript\nthis.jalaliDateCalculator.convertToGeorgian(1397, 11, 22);\n// Expecting output of this line is: Date(2019, 2, 13); \nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about convertToGeorgian method. \nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the convertToGeorgian method.\nconvertToJalali\nThis method converts Georgian date to the jalali date. Output is an object implementing SimpleDateInterface.\nATTENTION: month number starts from 0, but day number starts from 1. Just like native javascript Date object.\nInput of this method is a native javascript Date object.\nExample:\ntypescript\nconst jalali = this.jalaliDateCalculator.convertToJalali(new Date(2019, 2, 13));\nconsole.log(jalali.year); // Expected output: 1397\nconsole.log(jalali.month) // Expected output: 11\nconsole.log(jalali.day) // Expected output: 22\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about convertToJalali method. \nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the convertToJalali method.\ncreateGDateFromDays\nCreates a javascript Date object from number of passed days in Georgian calendar representing Georgian date.\nExample:\ntypescript\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateCalculator.createGDateFromDays(2458736));\n// Expected output: Date(2019, 8, 9)\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about createGDateFromDays method. \nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the createGDateFromDays method.\nfirstDayOfJYearInMarch\nFirst day of the Farvardin month in Jalali calendar is in March month. This method returns the day number of starting day of new jalali year in March.\nThe day number starts from 1 not zero and is equal to the real numbers in the calendar.\nExample:\ntypescript\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateCalculator.firstDayOfJYearInMarch(1398));\n// Expected output: 21\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about firstDayOfJYearInMarch method. \nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the firstDayOfJYearInMarch method.\ngeorgianYearToJalaliYear\nConverts georgian year to the jalali year.

Output year is the georgian year that jalali year starts within it, not the year that starts in the winter of jalali year.\nExample:\ntypescript\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateCalculator.jalaliYearToGeorgianYear(1397));\n// Expected output: 2018\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about jalaliYearToGeorgianYear method.\nnumberOfPassedGDays\nCalculates the Julian Day number from Gregorian or Julian calendar dates.\nInput value of this method is a javascript Date object.\nExample:\ntypescript\nconst dateObj = new Date(2019, 8, 9);\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateCalculator.numberOfPassedGDays(dateObj));\n// Expected output: 2458736\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about numberOfPassedGDays method. \nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the numberOfPassedGDays method.\nnumberOfPassedJDays\nReturns number of passed days from source day in jalali calendar to the given jalali date.\nmethod declaration:\nnumberOfPassedJDays(jYear: number, jMonth: number, jDay: number)\njYear is a full Jalali year like 1397.\njMonth is month number starting from zero.\njDay in day number starting from one.\nExample:\ntypescript\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateCalculator.numberOfPassedJDays(1397, 0, 1));\n// Expected output: 2458199\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about numberOfPassedJDays method. \nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the numberOfPassedJDays method.\nnumOfGLeapYears\nThis function returns number of passed leap years from AD 621 until targetGYear.\nExample:\nExample:\ntypescript\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateCalculator.numOfGLeapYears(2018));\n// Expected output: 339\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about numOfGLeapYears method. \nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the numOfGLeapYears method.\nJalali Date\nWe always had problems with Jalali dates. Built-in javascript Date object created for Georgian date and everything has been built for that object.\nNow, in ngx-persian, we solved the problem for ever.\nWe provided a class named JDate. This class implemented javascript native Date. So you have access to all the methods and behaviours of that object, now in Jalali.\nAlso you can use objects of JDate everywhere accepts javascript native Date object.\nThat means you can use all libraries, services and ... those are working with javascript Date object, with Jalali date. without any need for changing things or writing them for Jalali date from scratch.\nThis is the end of bad days for Iranian developers.&#x1F377;&#x1F377;&#x1F377;\nHow to add JDate to your project?\nFor using JDate, you only need to import it in the file you are working on it:\nimport {JDate} from 'ngx-persian';\nHow to create instances of JDate\nThere are many ways to create a Jalali Date object for your convenience.\n1. getting current date and time by creating an instance without any parameter: new JDate()\n2. Creating JDate object from a jalali date string as described in the\n pars method document, you can pass that string as\n first parameter and leave others empty. new JDate('11 دی 1348 00:00:00')\n 3. Creating JDate object from number of passed milliseconds from UNIX epoch: new JDate(-12600000)\n 4. Creating JDate object from a Georgian Date object and convert that date to the Jalali date effortlessly: new JDate(new Date(2018, 1, 1))\n 5. Creating JDate object from date and time values: new JDate(1397, 12, 25) or new JDate(1397, 12, 25, 12, 32, 45, 123)\nAs I said, This class implements entire Date object, so there are many methods and you can do anything you could do with javascript Date , \nplus some additional methods for simpler use like format method that formats date and time in desired pattern.\nYou can see complete document of all methods of this class by clicking on this text.\nAlso you can get more clear vision of each method by viewing unit test of JDate class here.\nBy using this class in your app, you never need another help for working and validating Jalali date and time.\nValidators\nThere are different validators for reactive forms. You can use them in your forms for validating data related to Iran or Farsi language without any need for writing new code.\npersianNumbersValidator\nReactive form validator that checks form control value contains only persian numbers.\nAdding persianNumbersValidator to your code\nFirst you should add validator in your component:\nimport {persianNumbersValidator} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen you should add it to validators list of desired FormControl. That's it.\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about persianNumbersValidator. \nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the persianNumbersValidator.\npersianNumbersValidator\nReactive form validator that checks form control value contains only persian numbers.\nAdding  persianLettersValidator to your code\nFirst you should add validator in your component:\nimport {persianLettersValidator} from 'ngx-persian';\nReactive form validator that checks form control value contains only persian letters and allowed characters in the options parameter.\nThis validator gets an optional options parameter as isPersian method of PersianLetterService.\nFor validating only persian letters without any other character (default behavior), you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator()\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nFor validating only persian letters and whitespaces, you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator({whitespaces: true})\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nFor validating only persian letters and english digits, you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator({enDigits: true})\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nFor validating only persian letters and persian digits, you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator({persianDigits: true})\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nFor validating only persian letters and symbols, you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator({symbols: true})\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nYou can validate inputs with any combination of these options.\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about persianLettersValidator. \nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the persianLettersValidator.\nDirectives\nFor template-driven forms, we also provided Two directives those using above validator functions.\nRead code document of PersianLetterDirective or [code document of PersianNumbersDirective].(https://alihoseiny.github.io/ngx-persian/directives/PersianNumbersDirective.html)\nContribution\nWe want to keep this library fresh and useful for all Iranian developers.
