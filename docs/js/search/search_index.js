Also THANK YOU for your help.\nThere are many ways you can help this project and all Iranian and Persian speakers all around the word:\nFind A Bug\nThe simplest thing that you can do is if you see any bug, bad code and etc, open an issue and tell us there is a problem.\nThis way you can help us find problems.\nBut please before creating new issue, search for simmilar issues and avoid opening duplicated issues.\nRequesting New Features\nAnother helpful thing you can do is requesting a useful feature that is not in the library yet. For this, you can open an issue and request a feature for implementing.\nAdding New Features\nAnd most helpful thing is adding new features in the library.\nHow You can Help All Iranian Angular Developers?\nYou are wondering how you can contribute in this project? Here is a list of what you can do:\n\nYou did anything useful and special for Iranian apps? So you can add that in this library and save other developers time.\nYou think number of tests for some part of this library is not enough? So you can write more tests.\nDocuments are not enough? You can help us by adding more documents.\nCurrent code could be better? You can make this cleaner or faster.\n\nYou should follow these steps for contributing in this project:\n1. Getting the Repository\nFor contributing, first fork the repository. Then create your branch and start coding.\n2. Follow the Flow\nWe are using git flow in this project for keeping things clean and maintainable. If you don't now how to use git flow, you can find it here in less than a minute.\n3. Add Tests\nWe are following TDD guides for developing this library, So you SHOULD add tests first and then add your code.\n4. Write the Dock\nAll codes should have complete in-code document following JSDoc syntax. Plus you should re-generate the code document using compodoc.\nFor generating documents, you should run following command in the project directory:\nnpm run generate-docs\nAlso you should add some documents about how to using a feature in the README.md file.\n5. Create A Pull Request\nNow you are done and want to add your code. So come here and create a new pull request. Please make pull request message complete and useful. Also you should keep all commit messages in your branch meaningful and useful.\nThank you for your contribution and make life easier for Iranian Angular developers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n

Date object for working with Jalali Date.\nYou can use Tools provided by this library for:\n\nConverting English numbers to Persian numbers and vise versa\nValidating persian text with different options\nValidating persian numbers for numeric inputs\nConverting and validating Jalali Date and time like native javascript Date object\nFormatting Jalali Dates using jdate pipe\nFormatting currency values in Rial or Toman currency type with flexable options.\nValidating and Formatting Iranian National Number\nValidating phone numbers of Iranian Mobile operators.\nGetting operator name of a phone number in English or Persian\nValidating reactive and template-base form inputs for persian numbers or texts.\n\nWhy you should use this library?\nThere are many reasons for using this library For everyone who develops an Angular application for people living in Iran:\n\nYou can find almost everything you need in a signle library and don't need to install thousand of different libraries.\nIt's developed for recent version of angular (v4 to v7) and is not out ot date like most of other libraries.\nWe solved problems in Angular way, not like most of other libraries those only glued a js solution to the Angular and Typescript.\nIt's alive! Many of other persian libraries have unanswered issues from 1-2 year ago.\nAlmost everything has been tested. There are more than 590 unit tests written for all parts. So you can use everything without any fear of breaking things down.\nIt's documented. Everything are clear and you can find anything you want from this document, code document and also unit test.\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNgxPersian\nWhy you should use this library?\n\n\nHow to Install?\nDocuments\nPipes\nfaNum\nenNum\nirc\nnationalCode\njdate\n\n\nServices\nPersianNumberService\nPersianLetterService\nMobilePhoneNumberService\nJalaliDateValidatorService\nJalaliDateCalculatorService\n\n\nJalali Date\nNationalCodeService\nValidators\npersianNumbersValidator\npersianNumbersValidator\n\n\nDirectives\n\n\nContribution\nThere is any problem?\nCitations\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Install?\nFor installing this library, you can simply run following command in your Angular app root:\nnpm install ngx-persian --save\nFor installing the library globally, you can run following command instead:\nnpm install ngx-persian -g\nDocuments\nShort documentation of the library is here. For more detailed documents, you can see the code document.\nPipes\nWe are using pipes for formatting values in the templates. We Have 4 Different pipes in the ngx-persian for formatting stuff needed by the persian app developers:\nfaNum\nThis pipe replaces all the English and Arabic digits to the Persian Digits without any need for additional code or parameter.\nFor using this pipe, firstly you need to import the pipe from the library in your module:\nimport {FaNumPipe} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen, like any other pipe, you need to declare the pipe in your module. For this, you should add following line in the declarations array of the @NgModule of your module:\nFaNumPipe,\nNow you can this pipe anywhere you like in your templates.\nFor example, if we want to convert non-english digits in a attribute named: englishTextDigit, we can use this code in our template:\n{{englishTextDigit | faNum}}\nenNum\nThis pipe replaces all the Persian Digits to English digits without any need for additional code or parameter.\nFor using this pipe, firstly you need to import the pipe from the library in your module:\nimport {EnNumPipe} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen, like any other pipe, you need to declare the pipe in your module. For this, you should add following line in the declarations array of the @NgModule of your module:\nEnNumPipe,\nYou can use this pipe anywhere you like in your templates for converting persian digits to english digits.\nFor example, if we want to convert persian digits in a attribute named: persianTextDigit, we can use this code in our template:\n{{persianTextDigit | enNum}}\nYou can see the example usage of these pipes in below GIF:\n\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app or see: related section in code document for EnNumPipe or see: related section in code document for FaNumPipe.\nAlso you can see unit tests of FaNumPipe and unit tests of EnNumPipe for more examples of how input and outputs could be.\nirc\nThis pipe formats currency values for two popular currency types in Iran: Rial and Toman.\nThis pipes accepts one optional parameter for declaring currency type And get's this value as first parameter.\nPossible values for currency type parameter:\n\n\n\nValue\nOutput currency type\n\n\n\n\nR\nریال\n\n\nRIAL\nریال\n\n\nT\nتومان\n\n\nTOMAN\nتومان\n\n\n\nThe default value is r, so if you don't set any currency type, this pipe will consider that you've chosen rial currency type.\nFor using this pipe, firstly you need to import the pipe from the library in your module:\nimport {IRCurrencyPipe} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen, like any other pipe, you need to declare the pipe in your module. For this, you should add following line in the declarations array of the @NgModule of your module:\nIRCurrencyPipe,\nYou can use this pipe anywhere you like in your templates for formatting a currency value in Iranian currency types.\nFor example, For converting a digit to rial:\n{{13750 | irc}} output will be: 13,750 ریال\nYou can pass currency type parameter as below:\n{{13750 | irc:'T'}}\nThe output will be like:\n137,750 تومان\nYou can see the example usage of this pipes in below GIF:\n\nFor example, below code recreates default behaviour of the pipe (Grouping each 3 digit from right):\n{{13750 | irc:'R'}}\nIn regular uses, you never need to pass the second parameter, but it's here for more special usages.\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app or see: related section in code document for IRCurrencyPipe.\nAlso you can see unit tests of IRCurrencyPipe for more examples of how input and outputs could be.\nnationalCode\nThis pipe formats a 10-digit string to national code format like:\nxxx-xxxxxx-x\nFor using this pipe, firstly you need to import the pipe from the library in your module:\nimport {NationalCodePipe} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen, like any other pipe, you need to declare the pipe in your module. For this, you should add following line in the declarations array of the @NgModule of your module:\nNationalCodePipe,\nYou can use this pipe anywhere you like in your templates for formatting iranian national number.\nFor example: 0011753646 | nationalCode produces following text: 001-175364-6\nYou can see the example usage of this pipes in below GIF:\n\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app or see: related section in code document for NationalCodePipe.\nAlso you can see unit tests of NationalCodePipe for more examples of how input and outputs could be.\njdate\nThis pipe formats JDate object and creates a human readable text with different pre-defined formats. Also you can pass your custom format to it.\nIf you pass instances of Date class those representing Georgian DateTime objects, this pipe first convert that object to an instance of JDate class, and then returns formatted Jalali datetime from it.\nYou can pass Format name or custom format pattern as second parameter of this pipe.\nFor using this pipe, firstly you need to import the pipe from the library in your module:\nimport {JdatePipe} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen, like any other pipe, you need to declare the pipe in your module. For this, you should add following line in the declarations array of the @NgModule of your module:\nJdatePipe,\nYou can use this pipe anywhere you like in your templates for formatting Jalali dates as JDate objects or converting and then formatting Georgian dates as Date objects.\nFor example:  dateObject | jdate produces following text: 23 اردیبهشت 1397، 12:12 ب.ظ'\nFor changing formatting pattern, you can set second parameter like this:\ndateObject| jdate:'SHORT' That produces this result: 97/2/23 12:12 ب.ظ \nBelow you can see list of pre-defined formats:\n\n\n\nFormat name\nEquivalent Pattern String\nExample Result\n\n\n\n\nSHORT\nyy/m/d h:M t\n97/2/23 12:12 ب.ظ'\n\n\nSHORT_DATE\nyy/m/d h:M t\n97/2/23 12:12 ب.ظ\n\n\nMEDIUM\nd mmm yyyy، h:M t\n23 اردیبهشت 1397، 12:12 ب.ظ\n\n\nMEDIUM_DATE\nd mmm yyyy، h:M t\n23 اردیبهشت 1397، 12:12 ب.ظ\n\n\nLONG\nd mmm yyyy، h:M:S T\n23 اردیبهشت 1397، 12:12:30 بعد از ظهر\n\n\nLONG_DATE\nd mmm yyyy، h:M:S T\n23 اردیبهشت 1397، 12:12:30 بعد از ظهر\n\n\nSHORT_TIME\nh:M t\n12:12 ب.ظ\n\n\nMEDIUM_TIME\nh:M:S t\n12:12:30 ب.ظ\n\n\nLONG_TIME\nh:M:S.l T\n12:12:30.300 بعد از ظهر\n\n\n\nAlso instead of those pattern names, you can set your desired pattern string as described in the documents of format method of JDate object.\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app or see: related section in code document for JdatePipe.\nAlso you can see unit tests of JdatePipe for more examples of how input and outputs could be.\nServices\nWe provide some useful Angular Services for data validation and conversion.

Simple as this:\nimport {MobilePhoneNumberService} from 'ngx-persian';\nFor Injecting this service, you just need to add it in the constructor of your service or component like this:\nconstructor(private mobilePhoneNumberService: MobilePhoneNumberService) {}\nNow you can use it like other attributes of your class with this keyword.\nSo lets digging deep to the class and see what its methods do:\nisPhoneNumberPatternValid\nThis method only checks if phoneNumber follows valid pattern. means starting by +98 or 0, then a 9 digit and then 9 digits. This method will not check validity of the phoneNumber code and can accept invalid strings those only locking like phone numbers and in reality are not a valid phone number.\nExample:\nif (this.mobilePhoneNumberService.isPhoneNumberPatternValid('09357413028')) {\n  console.log('phone number follows correct pattern');\n} \n\nif (!this.mobilePhoneNumberService.isPhoneNumberPatternValid('912475')) {\n  console.log('phone number is not valid.');\n} For more information you can see the related part of code document about isPhoneNumberPatternValid method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the  isPhoneNumberPatternValid method.\ngetPhoneNumberOperator\nThis method first checks input for following correct pattern explained in the isPhoneNumberPatternValid method.\nThen, Checks all codes of all operators in MobileCodes object. IF finds a matched code, returns persian or english name of that operator from operatorsNames enum.\nIn default, Persian name of operator will return. For controlling language of the output, you can use second optional parameter (nameInEnglish) of this method.\nBy passing true, operator name will return in English. Default value of nameInEnglish parameter is `false.\nIf there is no recognizable operator for inputted mobile number, a InvalidMobileOperatorError will throw.\nAlso if input string does not follow correct pattern, an InvalidMobilePhoneNumberError will throw.\nSupporting Mobile operator companies are listed in table below:\n\n\n\nOperator Name in English\nنام فارسی اپراتور\n\n\n\n\nIRANCELL\nایرانسل\n\n\nMCI\nهمراه اول\n\n\nTALIA\nتالیا\n\n\nRIGHTEL\nرایتل\n\n\nSPADAN\nاسپادان\n\n\nTKC\nشبکه مستقل تلفن همراه کیش\n\n\nSHATEL\nشاتل\n\n\nAPTEL\nآپتل\n\n\nAZARTEL\nآذرتل\n\n\nSAMANTEL\nسامانتل\n\n\nLOTUSTEL\nلوتوس‌تل\n\n\nANARESTAN\nانارستان\n\n\n\nWe've provided an enum named operatorsNames you can see it here.\nExample:\nconsole.log(this.mobilePhoneNumberService.getPhoneNumberOperator('09352479965'));\n// Expected output: ایرانسل\n\nconsole.log(this.mobilePhoneNumberService.getPhoneNumberOperator('+989352479965', true));\n// Expected output: irancellFor more information you can see the related part of code document about getPhoneNumberOperator method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the   getPhoneNumberOperator method.\nisValidPhoneNumber\nIf phoneNumber follows correct pattern and has valid operator, returns true. Otherwise returns false.\nExample:\nif (this.mobilePhoneNumberService.isValidPhoneNumber('09195574410')) {\n  console.log('mobile phone number is valid.');\n}\n\nif (this.mobilePhoneNumberService.isValidPhoneNumber('09005574410')) {\n  console.log('mobile phone number is not valid.');\n}For more information you can see the related part of code document about isValidPhoneNumber method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the isValidPhoneNumber method.\nnormalizePhoneNumber\nRemoves +98 from the phoneNumber and replaces it with a 0 character. This method will not make any validation on the input.\nExample:\nconsole.log(this.mobilePhoneNumberService.normalizePhoneNumber('+989352479965'));\n// Expected output: 09352479965For more information you can see the related part of code document about normalizePhoneNumber method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the normalizePhoneNumber method.\nJalaliDateValidatorService\nMethods of this Service doing validation stuff on a Jalali date. You can use this Service using DI in all around of your app for validating Jalali dates without needing to convert them to the Georgian Date.\nAdding JalaliDateValidatorService to Your Application\nFor using this service you only need to import it in the file you want to use that in it. Simple as this:\nimport {JalaliDateValidatorService} from 'ngx-persian';\nFor Injecting this service, you just need to add it in the constructor of your service or component like this:\nconstructor(private jalaliDateValidatorService: JalaliDateValidatorService) {}\nNow you can use it like other attributes of your class with this keyword.\nSo lets digging deep to the class and see what its methods do:\nisJYearLeap\nThis method gets a Jalali year as input. It jalali year is a leap year, returns true. If not, returns false.\nExample:\nif (this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isJYearLeap(1375)) {\n  console.log('1375 is a leap year.');\n} \n\nif (!this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isJYearLeap(1397)) {\n  console.log('1397 is not a leap year.');\n} For more information you can see the related part of code document about isJYearLeap method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the isJYearLeap method.\nisValidJDate\nIf Jalali date is not a valid Jalali date, return false. otherwise returns true.\nInput format of this method is:\nisValidJDate(jYear, jMonth, jDay)\njYear is a Jalali year. jMonth is number of month starting from zero. jDay is day number starting from one.\nCombination of year, month and day should be a valid date in the calendar.\nExample:\nif (this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJDate(1375, 11, 30)) {\n  console.log('Input is a valid Jalali date.');\n} \n\nif (!this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJDate(1397, 11, 30)) {\n  console.log('Input is not a valid Jalali date.');\n}  For more information you can see the related part of code document about isValidJDate method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the isValidJDate method.\nisValidJDay\nChecks if day number is in valid range according to the given year and month.\nFirst six month of the year have 31 days. 5 next months have 30 days and last month maybe has 29 or 30 days.\nThis method checks is day number in the valid range of day numbers of the month in a particular year or not.\nExample:\nif (this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJDay(1375, 11, 30)) {\n  console.log('Input day is valid in Jalali calendar.');\n} \n\nif (!this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJDay(1397, 11, 30)) {\n  console.log('Input is not valid in Jalali calendar.');\n} For more information you can see the related part of code document about isValidJDay method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the isValidJDay method.\nisValidJMonth\nChecks if jalali month is in valid range or not. In default, jMonth should start from zero. If you want to start month number from one instead of zero, you should make startFromZero parameter to false.\nisValidJMonth(jMonth: number, startFromZero: boolean)\nBe careful about month number. Only in this method you can choose starting month number from one or zero. In others, month number starts only from zero.\nExample:\nif (this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJMonth(12, false)) {\n  console.log('Month is valid.');\n} \n\nif (!this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJMonth(12)) {\n  console.log('Month is not valid');\n} For more information you can see the related part of code document about isValidJMonth method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the isValidJMonth method.\nisValidJYear\nChecks if jalali year is in acceptable range or not. Acceptable range for this validator is from -61 to 3177.\nExample:\nif (this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJYear(1397)) {\n  console.log('Year is valid.');\n} \n\nif (!this.jalaliDateValidatorService.isValidJYear(3179)) {\n  console.log('Year is not valid');\n} For more information you can see the related part of code document about isValidJYear method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the isValidJYear method.\njMonthLength\nReturns number of days in a given month counting from 1.\n jMonthLength(jYear: number, jMonth: number)\njYear is Jalali year number and jMonth is month number starts from zero.\noutput is number of days in given month. First six months of the year have 31 days. 5 next months have 30 days and last month maybe has 29 or 30 days.\nExample:\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateValidatorService.jMonthLength(1375, 11));\n// Expected output: 30\n\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateValidatorService.jMonthLength(1397, 0));\n// Expected output: 31For more information you can see the related part of code document about jMonthLength method.\nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the jMonthLength method.\nnumOfJLeapYears\nReturn number of leap years passed from base year until given Jalali year.\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about numOfJLeapYears method.\nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the numOfJLeapYears method.\nJalaliDateCalculatorService\nThis service converts Georgian date to Jalali and vase versa. You can use all of the methods as static methods.\nAdding JalaliDateCalculatorService to Your Application\nFor using this service you only need to import it in the file you want to use that in it. Simple as this:\nimport {JalaliDateCalculatorService} from 'ngx-persian';\nFor Injecting this service, you just need to add it in the constructor of your service or component like this:\nconstructor(private jalaliDateCalculatorService: JalaliDateCalculatorService) {}\nNow you can use it like other attributes of your class with this keyword.\nJalaliDateValidatorService injected into this service. So if you want to create an instance of this service and don't want to use DI, you should pass an instance of that service in it. But if you are using DI as described before, you don't need to do anything at all.\nSo lets digging deep to the class and see what its methods do:\nconvertToGeorgian\nConverts a valid jalali date to a javascript Date object representing a equivalent Georgian date.\nthis method looking like:\nconvertToGeorgian(jYear: number, jMonth: number, jDay: number)\njYear is a full Jalali year like 1397.\njMonth is month number starting from zero.\njDay in day number starting from one.\nExample:\nthis.jalaliDateCalculator.convertToGeorgian(1397, 11, 22);\n// Expecting output of this line is: Date(2019, 2, 13);For more information you can see the related part of code document about convertToGeorgian method.\nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the convertToGeorgian method.\nconvertToJalali\nThis method converts Georgian date to the jalali date. Output is an object implementing SimpleDateInterface.\nATTENTION: month number starts from 0, but day number starts from 1. Just like native javascript Date object.\nInput of this method is a native javascript Date object.\nExample:\nconst jalali = this.jalaliDateCalculator.convertToJalali(new Date(2019, 2, 13));\nconsole.log(jalali.year); // Expected output: 1397\nconsole.log(jalali.month) // Expected output: 11\nconsole.log(jalali.day) // Expected output: 22For more information you can see the related part of code document about convertToJalali method.\nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the convertToJalali method.\ncreateGDateFromDays\nCreates a javascript Date object from number of passed days in Georgian calendar representing Georgian date.\nExample:\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateCalculator.createGDateFromDays(2458736));\n// Expected output: Date(2019, 8, 9)For more information you can see the related part of code document about createGDateFromDays method.\nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the createGDateFromDays method.\nfirstDayOfJYearInMarch\nFirst day of the Farvardin month in Jalali calendar is in March month. This method returns the day number of starting day of new jalali year in March.\nThe day number starts from 1 not zero and is equal to the real numbers in the calendar.\nExample:\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateCalculator.firstDayOfJYearInMarch(1398));\n// Expected output: 21For more information you can see the related part of code document about firstDayOfJYearInMarch method.\nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the firstDayOfJYearInMarch method.\ngeorgianYearToJalaliYear\nConverts georgian year to the jalali year. Output year is the jalali year that start within the Georgian year.\nExample:\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateCalculator.georgianYearToJalaliYear(2018));\n// Expected output: 1397For more information you can see the related part of code document about georgianYearToJalaliYear method.\njalaliYearToGeorgianYear\nConverts jalali year number to the georgian year. Output year is the georgian year that jalali year starts within it, not the year that starts in the winter of jalali year.\nExample:\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateCalculator.jalaliYearToGeorgianYear(1397));\n// Expected output: 2018For more information you can see the related part of code document about jalaliYearToGeorgianYear method.\nnumberOfPassedGDays\nCalculates the Julian Day number from Gregorian or Julian calendar dates.\nInput value of this method is a javascript Date object.\nExample:\nconst dateObj = new Date(2019, 8, 9);\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateCalculator.numberOfPassedGDays(dateObj));\n// Expected output: 2458736For more information you can see the related part of code document about numberOfPassedGDays method.\nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the numberOfPassedGDays method.\nnumberOfPassedJDays\nReturns number of passed days from source day in jalali calendar to the given jalali date.\nmethod declaration:\nnumberOfPassedJDays(jYear: number, jMonth: number, jDay: number) \njYear is a full Jalali year like 1397.\njMonth is month number starting from zero.\njDay in day number starting from one.\nExample:\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateCalculator.numberOfPassedJDays(1397, 0, 1));\n// Expected output: 2458199For more information you can see the related part of code document about numberOfPassedJDays method.\nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the numberOfPassedJDays method.\nnumOfGLeapYears\nThis function returns number of passed leap years from AD 621 until targetGYear.\nExample:\nExample:\nconsole.log(this.jalaliDateCalculator.numOfGLeapYears(2018));\n// Expected output: 339For more information you can see the related part of code document about numOfGLeapYears method.\nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the numOfGLeapYears method.\nJalali Date\nWe always had problems with Jalali dates. Built-in javascript Date object created for Georgian date and everything has been built for that object.\nNow, in ngx-persian, we solved the problem for ever.\nWe provided a class named JDate. This class implemented javascript native Date. So you have access to all the methods and behaviours of that object, now in Jalali.\nAlso you can use objects of JDate everywhere accepts javascript native Date object.\nThat means you can use all libraries, services and ... those are working with javascript Date object, with Jalali date. without any need for changing things or writing them for Jalali date from scratch.\nThis is the end of bad days for Iranian developers.🍷🍷🍷\nHow to add JDate to your project?\nFor using JDate, you only need to import it in the file you are working on it:\nimport {JDate} from 'ngx-persian';\nHow to create instances of JDate\nThere are many ways to create a Jalali Date object for your convenience.\n\ngetting current date and time by creating an instance without any parameter: new JDate()\nCreating JDate object from a jalali date string as described in the\npars method document, you can pass that string as\nfirst parameter and leave others empty. new JDate('11 دی 1348 00:00:00')\nCreating JDate object from number of passed milliseconds from UNIX epoch: new JDate(-12600000)\nCreating JDate object from a Georgian Date object and convert that date to the Jalali date effortlessly: new JDate(new Date(2018, 1, 1))\nCreating JDate object from date and time values: new JDate(1397, 12, 25) or new JDate(1397, 12, 25, 12, 32, 45, 123)\n\nAs I said, This class implements entire Date object, so there are many methods, and you can do anything you could do with javascript Date ,\nplus some additional methods for simpler use like format method that formats date and time in desired pattern.\nYou can see complete document of all methods of this class by clicking on this text.\nAlso you can get more clear vision of each method by viewing unit test of JDate class here.\nBy using this class in your app, you never need another help for working and validating Jalali date and time.\nNationalCodeService\nYou can use this service for validating Iranian national code (number) And finding out if user input is a correct National code or not.\nFor reading more detailed document, you can see [related part of the code document of the NationalCodeService] (https://alihoseiny.github.io/ngx-persian/injectables/NationalCodeService.html)\nAdding NationalCodeService to Your Application\nFor using this service you only need to import it in the file you want to use that in it. Simple as this:\nimport {NationalCodeService} from 'ngx-persian';\nFor Injecting this service, you just need to add it in the constructor of your service or component like this:\nconstructor(private nationalCodeService: NationalCodeService) {}\nNow you can use it like other attributes of your class with this keyword.\nSo lets digging deep to the class and see what its methods do:\nnormalize\nThis method normalizes inputs for being a 10-digit string.\nThis method removes whitespaces from sides of the input and adds zero character at the beginning of the input until the length of the result reach to 10.\nIf Input length is shorter than 8 or longer than 10, an [`InvalidNationalCodeError](https://alihoseiny.github.io/ngx-persian/classes/) will throw.\nExample:\nconsole.log(this.nationalCodeService(15234756));\n// Expected output is: '0015234756'\n\nconsole.log(this.nationalCodeService('015234756'));\n// Expected output is: '0015234756'\n\nconsole.log(this.nationalCodeService('0015234756'));\n// Expected output is: '0015234756'\n\ntry {\n  this.nationalCodeService('34756');\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log('Input length is less than 8 and an InvalidNationalCodeError throw');\n}\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about normalize method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the normalize method.\nisValid\nThis method first normalizes the input using normalize method and implicitly checks input length, So you DO NOT NEED to normalize input before, but this will not make any bad effect.\nThen checks the validity of the input for being a valid Iranian national code. If it's a valid code, return true. Otherwise returns false.\nExample:\nconsole.log(this.isValid(2365478824));\n// Expected output: true\n\nconsole.log(this.isValid(7731689951));\n// Expected output: falseFor more information you can see the related part of code document about isValid method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the normalize method.\nValidators\nThere are different validators for reactive forms. You can use them in your forms for validating data related to Iran or Farsi language without any need for writing new code.\npersianNumbersValidator\nReactive form validator that checks form control value contains only persian numbers.\nAdding persianNumbersValidator to your code\nFirst you should add validator in your component:\nimport {persianNumbersValidator} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen you should add it to validators list of desired FormControl. That's it.\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about persianNumbersValidator.\nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the persianNumbersValidator.\npersianNumbersValidator\nReactive form validator that checks form control value contains only persian numbers.\nAdding  persianLettersValidator to your code\nFirst you should add validator in your component:\nimport {persianLettersValidator} from 'ngx-persian';\nReactive form validator that checks form control value contains only persian letters and allowed characters in the options parameter.\nThis validator gets an optional options parameter as isPersian method of PersianLetterService.\nFor validating only persian letters without any other character (default behavior), you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator()\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nFor validating only persian letters and whitespaces, you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator({whitespaces: true})\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nFor validating only persian letters and english digits, you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator({enDigits: true})\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nFor validating only persian letters and persian digits, you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator({persianDigits: true})\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nFor validating only persian letters and symbols, you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator({symbols: true})\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nYou can validate inputs with any combination of these options.\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about persianLettersValidator.\nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the persianLettersValidator.\nDirectives\nFor template-driven forms, we also provided Two directives those using above validator functions.\nRead code document of PersianLetterDirective or [code document of PersianNumbersDirective].(https://alihoseiny.github.io/ngx-persian/directives/PersianNumbersDirective.html)\nContribution\nWe want to keep this library fresh and useful for all Iranian developers.
