                \n\nFirst of all, I am so happy to see this work seemed useful to you. Also THANK YOU for your help.\nThere are many ways you can help this project and all Iranian and Persian speakers all around the word:\nFind A Bug\nThe simplest thing that you can do is if you see any bug, bad code and etc, open an issue and tell us there is a problem.\nThis way you can help us find problems.\nBut please before creating new issue, search for simmilar issues and avoid opening duplicated issues.\nRequesting New Features\nAnother helpful thing you can do is requesting a useful feature that is not in the library yet. For this, you can open an issue and request a feature for implementing.\nAdding New Features\nAnd most helpful thing is adding new features in the library.\nHow You can Help All Iranian Angular Developers?\nYou are wondering how you can contribute in this project? Here is a list of what you can do:\n1. You did anything useful and special for Iranian apps? So you can add that in this library and save other developers time.\n2. You think number of tests for some part of this library is not enough? So you can write more tests.\n3. Documents are not enough? You can help us by adding more documents.\n4. Current code could be better? You can make this cleaner or faster.\nYou should follow these steps for contributing in this project:\n1. Getting the Repository\nFor contributing, first fork the repository. Then create your branch and start coding.\n2. Follow the Flow\nWe are using git flow in this project for keeping things clean and maintainable. If you don't now how to use git flow, you can find it here in less than a minute.\n3. Add Tests\nWe are following TDD guides for developing this library, So you SHOULD add tests first and then add your code.\n4. Write the Dock\nAll codes should have complete in-code document following JSDoc syntax. Plus you should re-generate the code document using compodoc.\nFor generating documents, you should run following command in the project directory:\nnpm run generate-docs\nAlso you should add some documents about how to using a feature in the README.md file.\n5. Create A Pull Request\nNow you are done and want to add your code. So come here and create a new pull request. Please make pull request message complete and useful. Also you should keep all commit messages in your branch meaningful and useful.\nThank you for your contribution and make life easier for Iranian Angular developers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n

Many of other persian libraries have unanswered issues from 1-2 year ago.\n* Almost everything has been tested. There are more than 590 unit tests written for all parts. So you can use everything without any fear of breaking things down.\n* It's documented. Everything are clear and you can find anything you want from this document, code document and also unit test.\nHow to Install?\nFor installing this library, you can simply run following command in your Angular app root:\nnpm install ngx-persian --save\nFor installing the library globally, you can run following command instead:\nnpm install ngx-persian -g\nDocuments\nShort documentation of the library is here. For more detailed documents, you can see the code document.\nPipes\nWe are using pipes for formatting values in the templates. We Have 4 Different pipes in the ngx-persian for formatting stuff needed by the persian app developers:\nfaNum\nThis pipe replaces all the English and Arabic digits to the Persian Digits without any need for additional code or parameter.\nFor using this pipe, firstly you need to import the pipe from the library in your module:\nimport {FaNumPipe} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen, like any other pipe, you need to declare the pipe in your module. For this, you should add following line in the declarations array of the @NgModule of your module:\nFaNumPipe,\nNow you can this pipe anywhere you like in your templates.\nFor example, if we want to convert non-english digits in a attribute named: englishTextDigit, we can use this code in our template:\n{{englishTextDigit | faNum}}\nenNum\nThis pipe replaces all the Persian Digits to English digits without any need for additional code or parameter.\nFor using this pipe, firstly you need to import the pipe from the library in your module:\nimport {EnNumPipe} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen, like any other pipe, you need to declare the pipe in your module. For this, you should add following line in the declarations array of the @NgModule of your module:\nEnNumPipe,\nYou can use this pipe anywhere you like in your templates for converting persian digits to english digits.\nFor example, if we want to convert persian digits in a attribute named: persianTextDigit, we can use this code in our template:\n{{persianTextDigit | enNum}}\nYou can see the example usage of these pipes in below GIF:\n\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app or see: related section in code document for EnNumPipe or see: related section in code document for FaNumPipe. \nAlso you can see unit tests of FaNumPipe and unit tests of EnNumPipe for more examples of how input and outputs could be. \nirc\nThis pipe formats currency values for two popular currency types in Iran: Rian and Toman.\nThis pipes accepts one optional parameter for declaring currency type And get's this value as first parameter.\nPossible values for currency type parameter:\n|Value|Output currency type|\n|---|---|\n|r|ریال|\n|rial|ریال|\n|t|تومان|\n|toman|تومان|\nThe default value is r, so if you don't set any currency type, this pipe will consider that you've chosen rial currency type.\nFor using this pipe, firstly you need to import the pipe from the library in your module:\nimport {IRCurrencyPipe} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen, like any other pipe, you need to declare the pipe in your module. For this, you should add following line in the declarations array of the @NgModule of your module:\nIRCurrencyPipe,\nYou can use this pipe anywhere you like in your templates for formatting a currency value in Iranian currency types.\nFor example, For converting a digit to rial:\n{{13750 | irc}} output will be: 13,750 ریال\nYou can pass currency type parameter as below:\n{{13750 | irc:'t'}}\nThe output will be like:\n137,750 تومان\nYou can see the example usage of this pipes in below GIF:\n\nAlso this pipes inherits the Angular decimal pipe. So you can choose different formatting styles for numeric part of formatted currency value and pass yor pattern as second parameter of the pipe.\nFor example, below code recreates default behaviour of the pipe (Grouping each 3 digit from right):\n{{13750 | irc:'r':'1.0-0'}}\nIn regular uses, you never need to pass the second parameter, but it's here for more special usages.\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app or see: related section in code document for IRCurrencyPipe. \nAlso you can see unit tests of IRCurrencyPipe for more examples of how input and outputs could be.\nnationalCode\nThis pipe formats a 10-digit string to national code format like:\nxxx-xxxxxx-x\nFor using this pipe, firstly you need to import the pipe from the library in your module:\nimport {NationalCodePipe} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen, like any other pipe, you need to declare the pipe in your module. For this, you should add following line in the declarations array of the @NgModule of your module:\nNationalCodePipe,\nYou can use this pipe anywhere you like in your templates for formatting iranian national number.\nFor example: 0011753646 | nationalCode produces following text: 001-175364-6\nYou can see the example usage of this pipes in below GIF:\n\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app or see: related section in code document for NationalCodePipe. \nAlso you can see unit tests of NationalCodePipe for more examples of how input and outputs could be.\nServices\nWe provide some useful Angular Services for data validation and conversion.

Creating JDate object from number of passed milliseconds from UNIX epoch: new JDate(-12600000)\n 4. Creating JDate object from a Georgian Date object and convert that date to the Jalali date effortlessly: new JDate(new Date(2018, 1, 1))\n 5. Creating JDate object from date and time values: new JDate(1397, 12, 25) or new JDate(1397, 12, 25, 12, 32, 45, 123)\nAs I said, This class implements entire Date object, so there are many methods and you can do anything you could do with javascript Date , \nplus some additional methods for simpler use like format method that formats date and time in desired pattern.\nYou can see complete document of all methods of this class by clicking on this text.\nAlso you can get more clear vision of each method by viewing unit test of JDate class here.\nBy using this class in your app, you never need another help for working and validating Jalali date and time.\nNationalCodeService\nYou can use this service for validating Iranian national code (number) And finding out if user input is a correct National code or not.\nFor reading more detailed document, you can see [related part of the code document of the NationalCodeService] (https://alihoseiny.github.io/ngx-persian/injectables/NationalCodeService.html)\nAdding NationalCodeService to Your Application\nFor using this service you only need to import it in the file you want to use that in it. Simple as this:\nimport {NationalCodeService} from 'ngx-persian';\nFor Injecting this service, you just need to add it in the constructor of your service or component like this:\nconstructor(private nationalCodeService: NationalCodeService) {}\nNow you can use it like other attributes of your class with this keyword.\nSo lets digging deep to the class and see what its methods do:\nnormalize\nThis method normalizes inputs for being a 10-digit string.\nThis method removes whitespaces from sides of the input and adds zero character at the beginning of the input until the length of the result reach to 10.\nIf Input length is shorter than 8 or longer than 10, an `InvalidNationalCodeError will throw.\nExample:\n```typescript\nconsole.log(this.nationalCodeService(15234756));\n// Expected output is: '0015234756'\nconsole.log(this.nationalCodeService('015234756'));\n// Expected output is: '0015234756'\nconsole.log(this.nationalCodeService('0015234756'));\n// Expected output is: '0015234756'\ntry {\n  this.nationalCodeService('34756');\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log('Input length is less than 8 and an InvalidNationalCodeError throw');\n}\n```\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about normalize method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the normalize method.\nisValid\nThis method first normalizes the input using normalize method and implicitly checks input length, So you DO NOT NEED to normalize input before, but this will not make any bad effect.\nThen checks the validity of the input for being a valid Iranian national code. If it's a valid code, return true. Otherwise returns false.\nExample:\n```typescript\nconsole.log(this.isValid(2365478824));\n// Expected output: true\nconsole.log(this.isValid(7731689951));\n// Expected output: false\n``` \nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about isValid method. Also for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the normalize method.\nValidators\nThere are different validators for reactive forms. You can use them in your forms for validating data related to Iran or Farsi language without any need for writing new code.\npersianNumbersValidator\nReactive form validator that checks form control value contains only persian numbers.\nAdding persianNumbersValidator to your code\nFirst you should add validator in your component:\nimport {persianNumbersValidator} from 'ngx-persian';\nThen you should add it to validators list of desired FormControl. That's it.\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about persianNumbersValidator. \nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the persianNumbersValidator.\npersianNumbersValidator\nReactive form validator that checks form control value contains only persian numbers.\nAdding  persianLettersValidator to your code\nFirst you should add validator in your component:\nimport {persianLettersValidator} from 'ngx-persian';\nReactive form validator that checks form control value contains only persian letters and allowed characters in the options parameter.\nThis validator gets an optional options parameter as isPersian method of PersianLetterService.\nFor validating only persian letters without any other character (default behavior), you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator()\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nFor validating only persian letters and whitespaces, you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator({whitespaces: true})\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nFor validating only persian letters and english digits, you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator({enDigits: true})\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nFor validating only persian letters and persian digits, you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator({persianDigits: true})\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nFor validating only persian letters and symbols, you can add validator to your FormControl like it:\npersianLettersValidator({symbols: true})\nYou can see the example usage in below GIF:\n\nYou can validate inputs with any combination of these options.\nStill have questions? see the related part of example app\nFor more information you can see the related part of code document about persianLettersValidator. \nAlso for more examples, you can see the unit tests of the persianLettersValidator.\nDirectives\nFor template-driven forms, we also provided Two directives those using above validator functions.\nRead code document of PersianLetterDirective or [code document of PersianNumbersDirective].(https://alihoseiny.github.io/ngx-persian/directives/PersianNumbersDirective.html)\nContribution\nWe want to keep this library fresh and useful for all Iranian developers. So we need your help for adding new features, fixing bugs and adding more documents.\nHow You can Help All Iranian Angular Developers?\nYou are wondering how you can contribute in this project? Here is a list of what you can do:\n1. You did anything useful and special for Iranian apps? So you can add that in this library and save other developers time.\n2. You think number of tests for some part of this library is not enough? So you can write more tests.\n3. Documents are not enough? You can help us by adding more documents.\n4. Current code could be better? You can make this cleaner or faster.\nYou should follow these steps for contributing in this project:\n1. Getting the Repository\nFor contributing, first fork the repository. Then create your branch and start coding.\n2. Add Tests\nWe are following TDD guides for developing this library, So you SHOULD add tests first and then add your code.\n3. Write the Dock\nAll codes should have complete in-code document following JSDoc syntax. Plus you should re-generate the code document using compodoc.\nFor generating documents, you should run following command in the project directory:\nnpm run generate-docs\nAlso you should add some documents about how to using a feature in the README.md file.\n4. Create A Pull Request\nNow you are done and want to add your code. So come here and create a new pull request. Please make pull request message complete and useful. Also you should keep all commit messages in your branch meaningful and useful.\nThank you for your contribution and make life easier for Iranian Angular developers.\nThere is any problem?\nIf you have questions, find some bugs or need some features, you can open an issue and tell us. For some strange reasons this is not possible? so contact me by this email: salam@alihoseiny.ir.\nCitations\nI should say a thank you to developers of jalaali js and it's implementation in Type script: jalaali Helper in Typescript Because I used their code in Jalali services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2019 Mr Alihoseiny\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
